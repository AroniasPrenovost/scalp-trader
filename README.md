- Polygon (MATIC): `matic-network`

To find other IDs:
- Visit https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list
- Or visit the CoinGecko website and check the URL (e.g., `coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin` â†’ ID is `"bitcoin"`)

## Historical Data Backfilling

Before the bot has accumulated enough price history naturally, you can backfill historical data from CoinGecko. This is useful for enabling technical analysis and AI decision-making from day one.

### How the Backfilling Function Works

The backfilling script (`backfill_historical_data.py`) performs the following operations:

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Queries the CoinGecko API for historical market data (prices and volumes)
   - Uses the `/market_chart/range` endpoint to fetch data within a specific time range
   - Automatically chunks large requests into 90-day periods to ensure optimal granularity

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converts CoinGecko's data format to match Coinbase's data structure
   - Calculates 24-hour percentage changes for both price and volume
   - Generates data points with: `timestamp`, `product_id`, `price`, `price_percentage_change_24h`, `volume_24h`, `volume_percentage_change_24h`

3. **Smart Merging**:
   - Loads any existing data from `coinbase-data/{SYMBOL}.json`
   - Merges new historical data with existing data using timestamp-based deduplication
   - Sorts all data points chronologically by timestamp
   - Only adds new data points that don't already exist (no overwrites)

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Respects CoinGecko API rate limits (30 calls/min for free tier)
   - Adds 2-second delays between API requests to prevent throttling
   - Displays progress for multi-chunk requests

### Data Intervals and Granularity

The data granularity you receive depends on the time period requested, following CoinGecko's automatic interval rules:

| Time Period | Data Interval | Data Points |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **1 day or less** | 5-minute intervals | ~288 per day |
| **1-90 days** | Hourly intervals | ~24 per day |
| **Above 90 days** | Daily intervals | ~1 per day |

**Important**: The backfill script automatically **chunks requests into 90-day periods** to ensure you get **hourly granularity** instead of daily, even for longer time periods. For example:
- Requesting 180 days (6 months) = 2 API requests of 90 days each
- Requesting 365 days (1 year) = 5 API requests of ~73 days each
- Result: ~4,320 hourly data points for 6 months, instead of just ~180 daily points

### How Far Back Can You Backfill?

The backfill time range is controlled by the `data_retention.max_hours` setting in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "data_retention": {
    "max_hours": 4380,        // 4,380 hours = ~6 months (182.5 days)
    "interval_seconds": 3600  // Not used for backfilling (only for live data collection)
  }
}
```

**Limitations**:
- **CoinGecko Free Tier**: Maximum 365 days (1 year) of historical data
- **Bot Default**: 4,380 hours (~6 months / 182.5 days)
- If you request more than 365 days, the script automatically limits to 365 days

**Examples**:
- `"max_hours": 720` â†’ 30 days of data (~720 hourly data points)
- `"max_hours": 2160` â†’ 90 days of data (~2,160 hourly data points)
- `"max_hours": 4380` â†’ 182.5 days of data (~4,380 hourly data points)
- `"max_hours": 8760` â†’ Requested 365 days, limited to 365 days (~8,760 hourly data points)

### Data Structure

Each backfilled data point matches the Coinbase format and includes:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1697385600.0,           // Unix timestamp (seconds)
  "product_id": "BTC-USD",             // Trading pair symbol
  "price": "28453.21",                 // Current price in USD
  "price_percentage_change_24h": "2.34",  // Percentage change from 24h ago
  "volume_24h": "15234567890.12",      // 24-hour trading volume in USD
  "volume_percentage_change_24h": "-1.23" // Percentage change in volume from 24h ago
}
```

**Percentage Change Calculations**:
- **24-hour lookback**: Compares current value with value from 96 data points ago (96 Ã— 15-min intervals = 24 hours)
- First 24 hours of data will have `"0"` for percentage changes (insufficient historical data)
- Calculated for both price and volume metrics

### Setup

1. Get a CoinGecko API key from https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard

2. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Enable backfilling in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "coingecko": {
       "enable_backfilling_historical_data": true
     },
     "data_retention": {
       "max_hours": 4380,
       "interval_seconds": 3600
     }
   }
   ```

4. Ensure each asset has a `coingecko_id` in the config:
   ```json
   {
     "wallets": [
       {
         "symbol": "BTC-USD",
         "coingecko_id": "bitcoin",
         "enabled": true
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Running the Backfill

Run the backfill script to fetch historical data:

```bash
python3 backfill_historical_data.py
```

The script will display progress information:
```
============================================================
CoinGecko Historical Data Backfill

  âœ“ Added 4368 new data points, total: 4368
âœ“ Saved 4368 data points to coinbase-data/BTC-USD.json
  âœ“ Backfill complete for BTC-USD
```

### Best Practices

- **Run backfill before starting the bot** for the first time to populate historical data immediately
- **Re-run periodically** if you've had the bot stopped for extended periods to fill gaps
- **Don't worry about duplicates** - the merge function automatically deduplicates by timestamp
- **Start with smaller time periods** (e.g., 30-90 days) when testing to reduce API calls
- **Monitor API rate limits** - the script includes delays, but be mindful of CoinGecko's 30 calls/min limit on free tier

### Troubleshooting

**Script says backfilling is disabled:**
- Check `config.json` and ensure `"enable_backfilling_historical_data": true`

**CoinGecko API key errors:**
- Verify your API key is correctly added to `.env`
- Check that your API key is active at https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard

**Rate limit errors:**
- The script includes 2-second delays between requests
- If you still hit limits, the free tier allows 30 calls/min
- Consider upgrading to a paid CoinGecko plan for higher limits

**Missing coingecko_id:**
- Each enabled asset needs a `coingecko_id` field in `config.json`
- Find IDs at https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list or on CoinGecko.com URLs

## How It Works

### Main Trading Loop

The bot runs continuously in a loop (default: every 15 minutes):

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetches current prices from Coinbase API
   - Appends price data to per-symbol JSON files in `coinbase-data/`
   - Calculates 24-hour volume changes

2. **Order State Management**
   - Checks the last order status for each symbol (`none`, `buy`, `sell`, or `placeholder`)
   - If `placeholder` (pending), polls Coinbase for final order status

3. **Market Analysis** (when needed)
   - Loads historical trading context (last N trades for learning)
   - Generates multi-timeframe charts (24-hour, 7-day, 90-day)
   - Calls GPT-4o Vision API with:
     - Chart images (high detail for short-term, lower detail for medium/long-term)
     - Historical trade screenshots (if LLM learning is enabled)
     - Current price/volume data
     - Cost structure (fees, taxes)
   - Receives JSON analysis with: buy price, sell price, confidence level, trade recommendation

4. **Trading Logic**

   **If no position (last order = 'none' or 'sell')**:
   - If AI recommends `buy` AND confidence is `high` AND market trend is `bullish`:
     - If current price â‰¤ buy-in price:
       - Calculate shares to buy (USD amount Ã· current price, rounded down)
       - Place market buy order on Coinbase
       - Take screenshot of chart at buy moment
       - Save order to ledger

   **If holding position (last order = 'buy')**:
   - Calculate current profit including all costs
   - If current price â‰¤ stop loss price:
     - Place market sell order (Stop Loss trigger)
   - Else if profit percentage â‰¥ target percentage:
     - Place market sell order (Take Profit trigger)

   **After sell**:
   - Save complete transaction record with all metrics to `transactions/data.json`
   - Delete analysis file to trigger fresh analysis on next cycle
   - Start cooldown period (no trading for configured hours)

5. **Data Cleanup**
   - Remove price data older than retention window
   - Optionally prune old transaction records

### Trading Strategy

The bot uses a **Technical Analysis + AI Decision-Making** strategy:

#### Entry Signals
- Price reaches or falls below AI-calculated buy price
- RSI indicates oversold conditions
- Price touches lower Bollinger Band
- Market trend is bullish (confirmed across multiple timeframes)
- AI confidence level is HIGH
- Support level identified by multi-timeframe analysis

#### Exit Signals (Take Profit)
- Profit percentage reaches or exceeds target (after fees and taxes)
- Price reaches AI-calculated sell price
- Resistance level reached

#### Exit Signals (Stop Loss)
- Price falls below AI-calculated stop loss
- Immediate exit to prevent further losses

#### Market Filtering
- No buy signals in bearish markets
- No trades during low/medium confidence periods
- Respects cooldown periods after sells
- Position sizing limited to prevent over-allocation

### Learning Component

The LLM analyzes past winning and losing trades to identify:
- Entry conditions that historically worked (RSI levels, Bollinger Band positions, price actions)
- Optimal hold times for each specific asset
- Probability-weighted profit targets
- Risk factors observed in losing trades
- Support/resistance levels that have been repeatedly tested

Each completed trade adds to the learning dataset, improving future decision-making.

## Monitoring & Logs

### Console Output
The bot provides real-time status updates in the console:
- Current prices and volume changes
- Analysis stage (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- AI confidence levels and trade recommendations
- Order placement and execution
- Profit/loss calculations
- Error messages and warnings

### Email Notifications
You'll receive email alerts for:
- Buy order placements (with entry price and confidence level)
- Sell order executions (with profit percentage and hold time)
- Error conditions or crashes
- New Coinbase listings (if enabled)

### Transaction History
All completed trades are logged in `transactions/data.json` with complete details:
- Entry/exit prices and timestamps
- Gross profit, taxes, fees, and net profit
- Time held position
- Buy event screenshot path
- Symbol and trade metadata

### Analysis Files
Current AI analysis is cached in `analysis/{SYMBOL}_analysis.json` files, showing:
- Buy-in price and sell price recommendations
- Support and resistance levels
- Confidence level and market trend
- Trade reasoning
- Profit target percentage

## Safety & Best Practices

### Start in Simulation Mode
1. Set `ready_to_trade: false` for all wallets initially
2. Set `enable_ai_analysis: true` to see what the AI would recommend
3. Monitor the console output and email notifications
4. Review the analysis files to understand the AI's decision-making
5. Only set `ready_to_trade: true` when you're confident in the bot's behavior

### Risk Management
- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
- Start with small `starting_capital_usd` amounts ($50-100)
- Set conservative `min_profit_target_percentage` (3-5%)
- Monitor the bot regularly, especially in the first few days
- Keep the `cooldown_hours_after_sell` setting to prevent over-trading

### API Security
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use API keys with trading permissions only (no withdrawal permissions)
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your Coinbase account for unauthorized activity

### Backtesting
- Use the historical data backfilling feature to test strategies
- Review past transaction records to understand win/loss patterns
- Adjust configuration based on observed performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not executing trades despite recommendations:**
- Check that `ready_to_trade: true` for the specific wallet
- Verify `enabled: true` for the wallet
- Ensure `enable_ai_analysis: true` to get recommendations
- Check that you have sufficient balance in your Coinbase account

**OpenAI API errors:**
- Verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` is correct
- Check that you have GPT-4o Vision access on your OpenAI account
- Monitor your OpenAI API usage limits and billing

**Coinbase API errors:**
- Verify your `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_API_SECRET` in `.env`
- Check that your API key has trading permissions
- Ensure your Coinbase account has sufficient balance

**Email notifications not working:**
- Verify all Mailjet credentials in `.env`
- Check your Mailjet account status and sending limits
- Verify email addresses are correct

**Missing historical data:**
- Run `python3 backfill_historical_data.py` first
- Verify `COINGECKO_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Check `enable_backfilling_historical_data: true` in config
- Ensure each wallet has a valid `coingecko_id`

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Asset Trading
Configure multiple wallets in `config.json` to trade different cryptocurrencies simultaneously:
```json
{
  "wallets": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTC-USD",
      "enabled": true,
      "ready_to_trade": true,
      ...
    },
    {
      "symbol": "ETH-USD",
      "enabled": true,
      "ready_to_trade": true,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Each asset maintains independent:
- Order ledger
- Transaction history
- Price data
- Analysis cache
- Learning context

### Custom Profit Targets
Adjust the global `min_profit_target_percentage` or let the AI calculate dynamic targets based on:
- Market volatility
- Historical performance
- Current confidence level
- Risk assessment

### Cooldown Periods
Configure different wait times based on analysis outcomes:
- `cooldown_hours_after_sell`: Pause after selling to let market settle
- `low_confidence_wait_hours`: Don't waste API calls on low-confidence signals
- `medium_confidence_wait_hours`: Brief pause before re-analyzing medium confidence
- `no_trade_refresh_hours`: How long to wait after "no trade" recommendation
